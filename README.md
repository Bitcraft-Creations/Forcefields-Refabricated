# Forcefields Refabricated

## Introduction

This document outlines the plan for porting the ModularForceFieldSystems (MFFS) mod to the Fabric mod loader. It includes a series of milestones for implementing features, a comprehensive feature list, and technical recommendations for learning and reference.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

- **Goal:** Implement a basic force field block that projects a fixed shield when powered.
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up the development environment with Fabric and the example mod.
  - Create a basic force field block.
  - Implement a simple energy storage system.
  - Enable the force field block to project a fixed shield when powered.

### Milestone 2: Basic Interaction and GUI

- **Goal:** Add user interaction and a graphical user interface (GUI) for the force field block.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement interaction logic for the force field block (e.g., right-click to open GUI).
  - Design and implement a basic GUI to display energy levels and control the shield.

### Milestone 3: Advanced Force Field Logic

- **Goal:** Enhance the force field functionality with adjustable size and shape.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement logic to allow users to adjust the size and shape of the force field.
  - Update the GUI to include controls for adjusting the force field parameters.

### Milestone 4: Additional Force Field Types

- **Goal:** Introduce different types of force fields (e.g., repulsion, attraction).
- **Tasks:**
  - Create new force field types with unique behaviors.
  - Implement a system for selecting and switching between different force field types.

### Milestone 5: Energy Systems and Integration

- **Goal:** Develop a more complex energy system and integrate with other mods.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement advanced energy storage and transfer mechanisms.
  - Ensure compatibility with popular energy systems from other mods (e.g., RF, EU).

### Milestone 6: Security and Permissions

- **Goal:** Add security features and permission settings for force fields.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement a system for setting permissions and security levels.
  - Update the GUI to manage security settings.

### Milestone 7: Polishing and Optimization

- **Goal:** Optimize the mod and prepare for public release.
- **Tasks:**
  - Perform code optimization and refactoring.
  - Thoroughly test the mod for bugs and performance issues.
  - Prepare documentation and tutorials for users.

## Comprehensive Feature List

- Basic force field block
- Energy storage and transfer system
- GUI for force field control
- Adjustable force field size and shape
- Different types of force fields (repulsion, attraction, etc.)
- Integration with other mods' energy systems
- Security and permissions for force fields
- Optimization and bug fixing
- Documentation and user guides

## Technical Recommendations

### Key Topics to Explore

- **Fabric API:**

  - Understanding the basics of Fabric's API and how it differs from Forge.
  - Exploring the Fabric wiki and example mods.

  - Blocks and Items: Creating custom blocks and items, registering them with Fabric.
  - Tile Entities: Managing data and logic for blocks that need to store state.
  - GUIs: Creating graphical user interfaces with Fabric's API.
  - Events and Listeners: Handling game events and player interactions.

- **Energy Systems:**

  - Implementing custom energy systems.
  - Integrating with existing energy systems (e.g., RF, EU).

- **Networking:**

  - Understanding how to send data between the client and server.
  - Implementing custom network packets.

- **Rendering:**
  - Custom block and item rendering.
  - Implementing visual effects for force fields.
